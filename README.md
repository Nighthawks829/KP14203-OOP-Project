## Sales record â€“ Point of Sale system
## About This Project
 The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, 
 - the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and 
 - indicates the options for the customer to make payment. It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. 
 - After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but can also be dispensed with or sent electronically.
